	<p>
	Heavycoin tries to make mining more accesible to the average
	user by providing a simple graphical user interface for
	controling it.  Our hope is that this will help spread the
	mining process around to more users, including non-technical
	users.  Additonally, the Heavycoin wallet has mining enabled
	by default so that the Heavycoin peer-to-peer network is
	immediately supported (and protected) by peers as they fire-up
	their Heavycoin wallets.  Simply put, we don't want to rely an
	mining pools alone.  Also, desktop-based mining is further
	supported by HEFTY1, which provides CPU-only mining without
	imposing hard memory requirements on the Heavycoin wallet.

	<p>
	  To enable mining, load up your wallet and select "Settings"
	  from the menu bar and then select "Options".  This will load
	  up the Options Dialog (see Figure 1).  To enable mining,
	  make sure the "Mine Heavycoins" tickbox is checked (item 1).
	  Next it's time to configure the amount of CPU you want to
	  contribute to processing Heavycoin transactions.  This is
	  done by adjusting the "Mining threads" settings (item 2).
	  If don't want Heavycoin killing your entire desktop machine,
	  then reduce this to 1.  Otherwise, if you want to mine more
	  heavycoins, then increase it to the maximum number of CPUs
	  on your computer.  This setting defaults to the number of
	  CPUs on your computer.
