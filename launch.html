    <p>
    Heavycoin has the potential to achieve massive adoption and become
    a wide-reaching crypto-currency.  With a strong community behind
    it, Heavycoin could even challenge Litecoin for position number
    two next to Bitcoin.  With this in mind, the Heavycoin launch is
    taking place in multiple stages to encourage a diverse body of
    early adopters and stakeholders.  Heavycoin will also leverage multiple
    launch strategies for maximum impact.
    </p>

    <h3>Dates and info</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IPO dates:</strong> Feb 17th - March 3rd, 2014</li>
      <li><strong>Mining starts:</strong> March 8th 12:00 UTC (bitcointalk.org forum time)</li>
      <li><Strong>Total supply:</strong> 63,000,000 - 128,000,000 HVC (depending on decentralized voting)</li>
      <li><strong>Premine:</strong> 1-2% (depending on total supply) for future development, support and maintenance</li>
      <li><strong>Wallets:</strong> Windows, Ubuntu, Debian and Max OSX available at launch</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Each launch stage focuses on a specific user group, such as
    miners, investors, developers, marketeers and journalists.  Our
    aim is that each group will be given a chance to become an early
    adopter and bring their unique talents and expertise to strengthen
    the Heavycoin community.  The following table summarizes the
    three launch phases, explaining their benefits and duration.

    <h2 class="page-header">IPO details</h2>

    <p>
    To invest in the Heavycoin IPO, simply send Bitcoin to the
    Heavycoin IPO address using one of the procedures outlined below.
    Investments must be received before 00:00 UTC Tues 3rd of March,
    2014.  Funds received after this time will be returned to sender,
    with the possible loss of the minimum Bitcoin transaction fees.
    </p>

    <h4>Key info</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start date:</strong> Mon Feb 17th 03:30 UTC</li>
      <li><strong>Cut-off date:</strong> Mon March 3rd 00:00 UTC</li>
      <li><strong>Heavycoin IPO address <img src="images/btc.jpg" alt="à¸¿"/></strong> <a href="http://blockchain.info/address/{{ site.HVCIPOAddr }}" target="_blank"> {{ site.HVCIPOAddr }}</a></li>
      <li><strong>Total IPO investment received so far:</strong> <a href="ipo-calculator.html"><span id="total_sold">Loading...</span></a> BTC</li>
      <li><a href="ipo-calculator.html">Live Investment Updates</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The 5,000,000 HVC will be distributed among the IPO investors
    proportional to how much BTC they have invested.  There is no
    limit on the amount of BTC investment.  The free market will
    determine the HVC exchange rate.  For example, if there were only
    two investors, Alice and Bob, and Alice invests 1 BTC and Bob
    invests 0.25 BTC, then Alice would get 80% (4M HVC), Bob would get
    20% (1M HVC) and the HVC exchange rate would be 0.00000025 BTC per
    HVC.
    </p>

    <p>
    Heavycoin IPO investors will be paid their HVC stakes instantly
    the moment the Heavycoin genesis block is released on March 8th,
    as soon as the network is launched and mining starts.  There will
    be no lengthy waiting period nor will there be a manual,
    error-prone disbursement of funds.  It will be an automatic
    process leveraging the genesis block.  Investors who want to take
    part in the IPO must follow one of the two IPO procedures below.
    </p>

    <h3>IPO procedure 1 (preferred)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the <a href="download.html">Heavycoin Keypair and Address Tool</a> for your platform</li>
      <li>Unzip to your Desktop</li>
      <li>Generate a Heavycoin keypair.  For example,<br/>
	<br/>
<pre><code>A) Launch the Command Prompt
B) cd %HOME%\Desktop
C) C:\Documents and Settings\Default User\Desktop>genkeys.exe

Heavycoin Private Key:  5Ht24yvS1gvp5RAMh2vUpvjrjmvt6fEymghVVC5XcD9G4byWYed
Heavycoin Public Key:   04c59d236644330ef4cbde55dd7a0e7da2471dcf7da99f045a37140f

      <br/>
      <code>Warning:  In Windows there will be an annoying line-wrap splitting your public key over two lines (see above).</code>
      </li>
      <li>Save your Heavycoin Private Key, Public Key and Address in a very safe place.<br/>
          <code>Warning: Keep your private key secret.</code><br/>
          <code>Warning: You will not be able to claim your HVC without these details!</code></li>
      <li>Send any amount of BTC to <strong>{{ site.HVCIPOAddr }}</strong><br/>
          Record the Bitcoin Transaction ID of your payment.</li>
      <li>Post a message to the <a href="{{ site.BTTANN }}" target="_blank">Heavycoin PRE-ANN thread</a> on bitcointalk.org with your Heavycoin Public key, Bitcoin Transaction ID and Amount sent.  For example,<br/>
	<br/>
	<pre><code>Heavycoin Public Key: 04c59d236644330ef4cbde55dd7a0e7da2471dcf7da99f045a37140fd79afda83353ccde09af728869db9cc06d05a96ec85c46ff78ef47661939d9012fa4c926f7

      <br/>
	<code>Warning: Be careful when copying and pasting the
	Heavycoin Public Key.  In Windows line-wrap splits the key in
	half and you need to make sure to paste it together without
	any mistakes.  If you make a mistake you will be unable to
	receive your HVC.</code><br/>
        Note: If you desire confidentiality, then send a PM instead.<br/>
        Note: If bitcointalk.org is down, you can send your message to us using our <a href="https://bitmessage.org" target="_blank">BitMessage</a> address {{ site.BMbroadcastAddr }}.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>IPO procedure 2 (easy option)</h3>

    <p>
    For users who find the genkeys procedure above too difficult or
    technically complex, you can make your HVC IPO investment with the
    following, simpler, less cool procedure.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Send any amount of BTC to <strong>19VzBYvffPj4JcJM6ieNBXLEY9dJBQ2oXa</strong><br/>
          Record the Bitcoin Transaction ID of your payment.</li>
      <li>Post a message to the <a href="{{ site.BTTANN }}" target="_blank">Heavycoin PRE-ANN thread</a> on bitcointalk.org with your Bitcoin Transaction ID and the Amount sent.<br/>
	<br/>
	<pre><code>Bitcoin Transaction ID: ...
Amount sent: 0.05 BTC</code></pre>
        Note: If bitcointalk.org is down, you can send your message to us using our <a href="https://bitmessage.org" target="_blank">BitMessage</a> address {{ site.BMbroadcastAddr }}.<br/>
        Note: If you desire confidentiality, then send a PM instead.
      </li>
     <li>
	We will perform the keygen procedure for you and send you
	bitcointalk.org PM confirming your investment and giving you
	your Heavycoin Address.  We will hold the private key on cold
	storage for you.
      </li>
      <li>
	When the Heavycoin genesis block is released, you will install
	the Heavycoin wallet and generate a receiving address.
      </li>
      <li>
	You will then send us a bitcointalk.org PM with the details
	about your stake and your Heavycoin receiving address.
      </lI>
      <li>
	We will perform a security check and send your HVC stake to
	the supplied Heavycoin address.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>IPO security</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>
      We will send you a bitcointalk.org PM confirming your IPO
      payment has been received.
    </li>

    <li>A few days before the release on March 8th, we will publish
      the current list of IPO stakeholders and we will attempt to
      resolve any issues that may occur.
    </li>

    <li>
      If we encounter any conflicts where multiple bitcointalk.org
      handles are claiming the same Bitcoin transaction Id, then we
      will contact the respective users and the legitimate key holder
      will be able to prove she owns the sending Bitcoin address by
      sending us a message signed by the corresponding Bitcoin private
      key(s).  Thus, any attempts to cheat will be completely futile.
    </li>

    <li>
      Advanced users who want to to sign their forum posts from the
      start are encouraged to do so.  In this case you must send your
      IPO payment from a single address and then sign their IPO forum
      post with the corresponding private key.  We can then verify
      that the Heavycoin Public Key does indeed correspond to that
      particular BTC payment.  Sending payments from a specific
      address can be achieved from the Bitcoin RPC interface OR using
      blockchain.info.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="page-header">Mining details</h2>

    <p>
    Heavycoin mining will open up a new dynamic because of
    decentralized block reward voting.  Miners who are greedy and have
    little stake could vote for the maximum block reward of 1024.
    However, this will increase the supply of Heavycoin and
    potentially decrease the price.  Other miners, who are not greedy,
    or who already have a sufficient stake, might vote for a lower
    block reward -- even zero -- in order to decrease the supply and
    to slow the minting rate.  Either way, this is going to be
    interesting!
