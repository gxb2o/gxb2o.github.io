		<p>
		Heavycoin is keen to become one of the top globally
		accepted digital payment systems.  To this end, the
		Heavycoin Foundation is offering bounties for commerce
		websites accepting Heavycoin as payment for goods and
		services.  The bounties are payable to whoever is
		responsible for the commerce site accepting Heavycoin
		as payment.  It may be split between the operator of
		the commerce website and the Heavycoin promoter.

		</p>

		<h3>Bounties for online businesses accepting Heavycoin</h3>
		<ul>
                  {% include bounties_merchants.html %}
		</ul>

		<h3>Banners</h3>

		<p>
		In order for the bounty to be paid the commerce
		website must demonstrate that it accepts Heavycoin by
		showing one of the following banners on its payment
		page.
