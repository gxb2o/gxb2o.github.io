          <h2><b>Ultra-secure</b></h2>
          <p>
             Heavycoin introduces a novel ultra-secure hashing
             algorithm that employs multiple redundant cryptographic
             hash functions to secure its block chain.  Bitcoin and
             other networks rely only on SHA-256, which was developed
             by the NSA.  The Snowden revolations bring into question
             the security of SHA-256 and, thus, the true government
             independence of Bitcoin.

          <h2>Democratic</h2>
          <p>
            Heavycoin is the first crypto-currency where the mining
            schedule and money supply are decided democratically by
            its user-base.  This is achieved by allowing miners to
            participate in a fully decentralized cheat-proof voting
            process.  The money supply still has a fixed upper-bound
            of 128M HVC.  Will there be 63M or 128M HVC?  How long
            until we get there?  You decide!

          <h2>CPU-only mining</h2>
          <p>
            To support the largest, most vibrant mining community,
            Heavycoin introduces a novel CPU-only cryptographic hash
            function called HEFTY1.  This enables anyone with a normal
            computer to mine Heavycoins and become a stakeholder.

            HEFTY1 works by breaking the SIMD (single-instruction,
            multiple-data) assumption that GPU and ASIC miners rely on.
