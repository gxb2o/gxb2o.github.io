    <p>
      Unlike most altcoins, Heavycoin has a strong developer backing
      who are comitted to its success.  Over time we hope the
      Heavycoin developer community will grow larger and our long-term
      goal is to form an open source Heavycoin Foundation for
      promoting and developing Heavycoin over many years to come.
